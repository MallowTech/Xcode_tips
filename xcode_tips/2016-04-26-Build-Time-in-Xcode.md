Ever wondered how long your builds in Xcode are taking? Hereâ€™s a quick way to show the build duration in seconds inside Xcode after each build:

```bash
defaults write com.apple.dt.Xcode ShowBuildOperationDuration -bool YES
```

2. Relaunch Xcode.
3. Build your project to see the duration of each build!
