tip-description: If you are localization in project. Then we should be very careful in handling xib/storyboard file. If we want different UI in different languages, then use the localised xib/storyboard file as Interfacebuilder Xib/Stroyboard format. If we want to use same UI in all language, then use the localised xib/storyboard file as localizable string format. Otherwise the changes in base language UI will not reflect in all other languages.
